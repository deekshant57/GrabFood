# grabFood

This assessment is to fetch the the longitude and latitude of resturants on a search page on GrabFood.com 
For this assessment, I used puppeteer because that can easily be used to intercept API calls during a test.

To run the code, 
- clone the repo
- run `npm install`
- run `node index.js`
- the path of the exported json file is `./restaurants.json`

Just click on "Load More" button once if it doesn't start automatically and rest code will handle it.
